# Trainee Selection OSF
Small site with the learnings I've learned in the trainee selection for OSF Global Services, a nice week where I've developed more my skills with front-end developing and did more connections with great people. This is also a test to trainee selection to work with front-end, I'm very excited with the result of this and I hope that more weeks like these come to happen. I've done a video where you can see all about what I have done in the site, where I explain everything (or almost that) about the process of developing, from the video on background to the animations:
